# DNAMatcher
DNAMatcher is a program, created using Java, to search for potential mutations in a DNA Sequence. It takes a file with two lines as an argument,
the first line has a sequence, where the template we want to use is in capital letters. The second line is the sequence where we will look for
potential mutations. 

I have provided a sample text file, so that others can see the format for which the program will work.

## Usage
The command with which to compile the code in Command Line is: (once in the directory with the java files) javac *.java

Once compiled, run the program using: java Matcher test.txt 

test.txt can be replaced with your own text file.
